## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the server by modifying `src/index.ts`. It will auto-updates as you edit the file.

To run in production:

```bash
yarn build
# then
yarn start
```
